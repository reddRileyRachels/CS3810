CS3810 Mini-Project 1 - Part 3: Heuristics (25 points, +10 bonus)
=================================================================

Every heuristic takes (state, problem) and returns a NUMBER: an estimate of
the remaining cost to clean all remaining dirty cells. Keep the signature
even where you do not need `problem` - the search functions call them all
the same way.

Remember what the cost model is. Every move costs 1 AND every CLEAN costs 1,
so a state with k dirty cells remaining always costs at least k. A heuristic
that forgets the CLEAN actions is admissible but weak.

Writing the code is the small half of this part. The report must argue that
h1 and h2 are admissible: say exactly what lower bound each one computes and
why the true remaining cost can never be smaller than it.

    can clean anything, and reaching the nearest one is the cheapest way to

    To earn the bonus it must be:
      1. Admissible - never overestimates the true remaining cost. You must
         argue this in the report. An inadmissible heuristic that finds
         short paths quickly is a different algorithm, not a better
         heuristic, and earns nothing.
      2. Dominant over h2 - h3(s) >= h2(s) for every state s.
      3. Supported by data - show the node counts next to h2's.

    If you are not attempting the bonus, leave this raising NotImplementedError
    and run_tests.py will skip it.

    A place to start thinking: h2 only ever looks at one dirty cell. After
    the robot reaches that cell it still has to get to all the others. What
    is a cheap-to-compute lower bound on THAT remaining travel?
