CS3810 Mini-Project 1 - Part 2: The Search Algorithms (100 points)
==================================================================

Implement dfs_search, astar_search, and idastar_search below. Do not change
the signatures or the return shapes: run_tests.py and the grading harness
unpack them exactly as documented.

You may NOT use a library implementation of DFS, A*, or IDA* (networkx,
simpleai, aima-python, ...). Using heapq, collections.deque, and the
provided PriorityQueue is expected and fine.

Metric definitions - use these, and say which you used in your report:

    nodes_expanded      A node is EXPANDED when it is removed from the
                        frontier and its successors are generated. Do not
                        count nodes that were merely generated.

    max_frontier_size   The largest number of live entries the frontier
                        ever held. For the PriorityQueue helper this is
                        len(queue), not len(queue.heap).

    iterations          (IDA* only) The number of depth-limited passes,
                        i.e. how many times the f-cost threshold was set.
                        A search that succeeds on the first threshold has
                        iterations == 1.

Suggested order of work: DFS first, then A*, then IDA*.

    Perform Depth-First Search.

    Args:
        problem: VacuumWorld instance

        Tuple (solution_path, nodes_expanded, max_frontier_size)
        solution_path: List of actions, or None if no solution
        nodes_expanded: Number of nodes expanded during search
        max_frontier_size: Maximum size of frontier during search

    Requirements:
        * Iterative, with an explicit stack. Do NOT recurse - you will hit
          Python's recursion limit on the larger grids.
        * Cycle detection with an explored set, or DFS will not terminate.
        * Returns the FIRST solution found. It will not be optimal, and it
          is not supposed to be.

    Hint: push (state, path_so_far) pairs. Push successors in reversed()
    order if you want the stack to explore them in ACTION_ORDER order.

    Requirements:
        * Priority queue ordered by f(n) = g(n) + h(n).
        * Handle REOPENING: if you find a cheaper path to a state you have
          already expanded, you must be able to improve it. The provided
          PriorityQueue supports this - pushing an item already in the
          queue replaces its priority instead of duplicating it.
        * With an admissible heuristic this MUST return an optimal
          solution. run_tests.py checks that against known optimal costs.

    Hint: keep a dict g[state] of best-known cost-so-far and a dict
    came_from[state] = (parent_state, action) to rebuild the path at the
    end. A helper like _reconstruct() below keeps the main loop readable.

    Requirements:

          next threshold is the smallest f-value that exceeded the current
          one.
        * Linear space: no explored set carried across iterations. You may
          track the states on the current path to avoid immediate cycles.
        * Returns an optimal solution.

    Structure that works (write DFS and A* first - this will make far more
